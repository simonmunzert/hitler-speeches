## modifications done so far (everything in GitHub archive)
	# 1f-prepare_merging_data.r
		# imported sociodemographic data
	# 1g-prepare_dataframe_points.r
		# drop election-wise incomplete cases: took varying missingness on social variables into account; probably undo this when these variables are not used!
	# 3a-analyze-pointdata.r:
		# modified matching strategy
		# modified function getDatMatch() to drop single case observations and adapt weights
		# added combined weights (weights from matching * population weights)
	# 3b-analyze-pointdata-robustness.r:
		# worked with updated performMatch() function
		# updated computations for geographic scope of events


## to do's:
	# 1:many match, caliper oder k nearest neighbors
	# DID-Tabellen vollstÃ¤ndig berichten
	# Sozio-Variablen dranmatchen, ins PS-Modell aufnehmen
	# Anekdoten zusammentragen
	# neue AVAR: Mitgliederzahlen (auch wg. posttreatment bias)

## matching procedure:
  # replace --> FALSE: all weights remain 1 (this is what we want to easily introduce the population weights, right?)
  # ratio: up to 20, 30: reduces number of unmatched controls. no unmatched treateds, but: weights for repeatedly sampled controls vary a lot
  # added caliper to reduce matching across large distances
 
## social context variables
	# added indicators for shares of (1) workers, (2) protestants, (3) people employed in agriculture
